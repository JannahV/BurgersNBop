I used DOCTYPE to start off the beginning of the code

I organized my code in order by using title, heading, body, seciton and nav to structure out what text and images go on the website

I googled images that best resembled the example given in class

I struggled with positioning of text and borders but managed to get them to look as neatly as possible

I used footers to note as the 'end' of the website.
